            <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" target="_blank">Switzerland - beauty of the roads</a></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Traveling through Switzerland is like driving through a postcard. The country's natural beauty is unmatched, and its roads offer a stunning showcase of the landscape. As I journeyed from Winterthur to St. Gallen, each bend in the road revealed breathtaking views. The well-maintained highways wind through lush valleys, beside crystal-clear lakes, and up into the majestic Swiss Alps. Also the traditional Swiss farms, visible from the road, add a rustic charm to the journey.</p>
